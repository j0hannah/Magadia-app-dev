## MY FAV FILS/SERIES

**How To Train Your Dragon**
I watched all the films available but I haven't watch any of the short films.
My favorite scene in the first movie **How to Train Your Dragon (2010)** is the scene where the name toothless came from.

*FUN FACTS*
1. Written and directed by former Disney stalwarts.
2. It's based on a book series. Some characters were invented for the film.
3. Legendary cinematographer worked on the film. Production team focused on dragon aesthetics.

**Lights Out**
I really like this horror moview, it makes me feel scared and i really like it.
The story is also top notch for me. Especially the cinematography is so amazing!!!
Kudos to the production team for making an amazing movie.
